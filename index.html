<h1>VacMon</h1>

<p>
VacMon provides real-time monitoring and historical views of Vac and Vcycle
resources. VM factories send updates to VacMon using the factory_status and
machinetype_status messages in the VacQuery protocol. VacMon stores the
contents of the messages in an ElasticSearch database. VacMon then presents
graphical and tabular summaries of the messages on this website.

<p>
The <a href="/258:15180::/">All Sites</a> view is the top level entry point
to the system.
